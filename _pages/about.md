Hi! I’m Bartek Tatkowski and I’m the world’s okayest programmer.

I’m also a pretty decent father and husband, make-do entrepreneur, alright podcaster and generally well-rounded individual. This is my place on the internet to get things of my chest.

## Projects

### Silly projects & domains
[https://SamVimesBootsTheory.com](SamVimesBootsTheory.com) – I found myself referencing a quote from a Terry Pratchett book so often I bought the domain.

[https://Monokrom.se](Monokrom.se) – A nice sounding domain name for future use

[https://StatligSkatt.se](StatligSkatt.se) – As a business owner I found myself googling for the state tax bracket level in Sweden fairly often. Up on it’s own domain it goes!

[https://Kodjobb.se](Kodjobb.se) – A small app I build to teach myself deploying .NET Core apps to vanilla Linux VPS’s

## Work with me
