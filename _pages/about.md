Hi! I’m Bartek Tatkowski and I’m the world’s okayest programmer.

I’m also a pretty decent father and husband, make-do entrepreneur, alright podcaster and generally well-rounded individual. This is my place on the internet to get things of my chest.

## Projects

### Silly projects & domains
[SamVimesBootsTheory.com](https://SamVimesBootsTheory.com) – I found myself referencing a quote from a Terry Pratchett book so often I bought the domain.

[Monokrom.se](https://Monokrom.se) – A nice sounding domain name for future use

[StatligSkatt.se](https://StatligSkatt.se) – As a business owner I found myself googling for the state tax bracket level in Sweden fairly often. Up on it’s own domain it goes!

[Kodjobb.se](https://Kodjobb.se) – A small app I build to teach myself deploying .NET Core apps to vanilla Linux VPS’s

[Swordle.se](https://swordle.se) – A Wordle clone in Swedish, built with Blazor.


## Work with me
